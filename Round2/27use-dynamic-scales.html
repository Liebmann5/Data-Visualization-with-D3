                           //^Pretty sure you should never initally consider height or width here and instead always think padding ?or anything else? because theres really no way to easily apply a starting point!!! Think about it, if you need to start at 0 you'll have to do (h - h) which isn't smart doofus!!! Also, think about starting at 5 you'd have to do ((h - h) + 5)==((h + 5) - h)

<!--
  Given a complex data set, one priority is to set the scale so the visualization fits the SVG container's width and height. You want all the data plotted inside the SVG canvas so it's visible on the web page.

  This sets the x-axis scale for scatter plot data. The domain() method passes information to the scale about the raw data values for the plot. The domain goes from 0 to the maximum in the set. It uses the max() method with a callback function based on the x values in the arrays.

  onst dataset = [
  [ 34,    78 ],
  [ 109,   280 ],
  [ 310,   120 ],
  [ 79,    411 ],
  [ 420,   220 ],
  [ 233,   145 ],
  [ 333,   96 ],
  [ 222,   333 ],
  [ 78,    320 ],
  [ 21,    123 ]
];
...
.domain([0, d3.max(dataset, (d) => d[0])])


  The range() method gives it information about the actual space on the web page for the visualization. The range uses the SVG canvas' width (w), but it includes some padding, too. This puts space between the scatter plot dots and the edge of the SVG canvas.

  const w = 500;
  const h = 500;

  const padding = 30;         //How does this create space between the scatter plot dots??? This is y-axis??
  ...
  .range([padding, w - padding]);


  The padding may be confusing at first. Picture the x-axis as a horizontal line from 0 to 500 (the width value for the SVG canvas). Including the padding in the range() method forces the plot to start at 30 along that line (instead of 0), and end at 470 (instead of 500).



How the code looks:
              const dataset = [
                [ 34,    78 ],
                [ 109,   280 ],
                [ 310,   120 ],
                [ 79,    411 ],
                [ 420,   220 ],
                [ 233,   145 ],
                [ 333,   96 ],
                [ 222,   333 ],
                [ 78,    320 ],
                [ 21,    123 ]
              ];
              const w = 500;
              const h = 500;

              const padding = 30;
              const xScale = d3.scaleLinear()
                .domain([0, d3.max(dataset, (d) => d[0])])
                .range([padding, w - padding]);
