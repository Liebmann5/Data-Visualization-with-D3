    // Often when you set the domain, you'll want to use the minimum and maximum values within the data set. Trying to find these values manually, especially in a large data set, may cause errors. D3 has two methods - min() and max() to return this information.
    // A dataset may have nested arrays, like the [x, y] coordinate pairs that were in the scatter plot example. In that case, you need to tell D3 how to calculate the maximum and minimum. Fortunately, both the min() and max() methods take a callback function. The callback function's argument d is for the current inner array. The callback needs to return the element from the inner array (the x or y value) over which you want to compute the maximum or minimum.
    const output = d3.max(positionData, (d) => d[2]);
