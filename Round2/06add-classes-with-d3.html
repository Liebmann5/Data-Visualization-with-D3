Q:
I don't understand what the last sentence means? 

Using a lot of inline styles on HTML elements gets hard to manage, even for smaller apps. It's easier to add a class to elements and style that class one time using CSS rules. D3 has the attr() method to add any HTML attribute to an element, including a class name.

The attr() method works the same way that style() does. It takes comma-separated values, and can use a callback function. Here's an example to add a class of container to a selection:

        selection.attr("class", "container");

Note that the class parameter will remain the same whenever you need to add a class and only the container parameter will change.

GPT:
The last sentence you provided is explaining that the attr() method can be used to add HTML attributes, including class names, to elements in a selection. It works in a similar way to the style() method, in that it takes comma-separated values and can use a callback function.

For example, the following code uses the attr() method to add a class of "container" to a selection of elements:

        selection.attr("class", "container");

The attr() method takes two arguments: the name of the attribute to add and the value to set for that attribute. In this case, the attribute being added is the "class" attribute and the value being set is "container".

As with the style() method, the attr() method can also use a callback function as the value argument. This allows you to set the value of the attribute based on the data bound to the elements in the selection. For example:

        selection.attr("class", (d) => { return (d < 20) ? "red" : "green" });

In this case, the callback function returns either "red" or "green" based on the value of d, and the attr() method sets the "class" attribute of the elements in the selection to the value returned by the callback function.
