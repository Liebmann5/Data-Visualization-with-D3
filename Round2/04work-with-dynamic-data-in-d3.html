      .data(dataset)
      .enter()
      .append("h2")
      // he last two challenges cover the basics of displaying data dynamically with D3 using the data() and enter() methods. These methods take a data set and, together with the append() method, create a new DOM element for each entry in the data set.

      //The D3 text() method can take a string or a callback function as an argument.
      .text((dataset) => dataset + " USD");   //callback = we send a f(n) as an argument
      /*BELIEF:I think!! an easier way to think about this is that ?each of these methods in this 'method chain' are handled 1 at a time? so d3.select("body").selectAll("h2")....text(callbackFunction) is only dealing with one h2 element at a time???? This would explain why we only need dataset as a parameter! and no specification for a specified index AND it's b/c d3.select("body").selectAll("h2")....text(callbackFunction) only handles one element at a time... which means we work through ever current element AND index!!!!!*/
